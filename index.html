            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">Target Hands</h3>
            <ul class="pl-4">

                <li>#8 - 2 runs of 4</li>

                <li>#10 - 1 set of 3, 1 run of 7</li>
                <li>#11 - 2 sets of 3, 1 run of 5</li>

            <p class="mt-4">In all cases you can have more cards in your sets or runs before laying down</p>
            <p class="mt-2">3 May I's maximum per hand, or 17 cards total in your hand</p>
            <p class="mt-2">
                After you lay your runs and sets down for each hand, you can then
                play any remaining cards in your hand on anyone else's cards that
                are down. Any wild card in a <span>run</span> can be replaced with
                the actual card, then move the wild card up or down in the run.
                When a run is full from Ace through 3, that run is dead and cannot
                be played on.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">Aces are always high</p>
            <p class="mt-2">2's and Jokers are wild cards</p>
